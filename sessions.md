Below is an outline of the techniques, methodologies and approaches that I use when working with clients in the context of healing and emotional release.

## Meditating

Many people recognise the benefits meditation bring to their lives.

On trying however people soon give up saying 'it's too hard' or 'I tried that...'. Often, a few simple adjustments to their technique brings amazing results. My website and social media hosts a series of videos showing how to improve your meditation. I also offer one on one sessions to help with your meditation process. This can be done over the internet or in person.

There are many health benefits associated with meditation such as lowering blood pressure, relaxation, controlling stress, experiencing more positive emotions, increased immunity to disease. Meditation has also been proven to be of help for various conditions such as depression and anxiety. But the essence of meditation is an internalisation of your consciousness. Meditation allows you to establish a deeper connection with your self on a daily basis.

Sometimes the cause of your meditation difficulties lie at a deeper cause and we can employ other techniques to resolve the blocking issue. My aim in working with you is to help you move into a deeper meditative state where an alignment and harmonising of mind, body and soul can take place.

Listed below is a brief overview of some of the processes I employ along with information on how sessions work.

## Working at the Source

Working at the source simply means working with causes rather than symptoms.

Many psychological and physical issues will exhibit similar symptoms on the surface but have completely different causes. This is why it's important to look for the source of what is happening for the individual.

The methods I use are not band-aid solutions. They are designed to help people know themselves deeply, to get in touch with their own essence and also to get to the core of issues that block them. I use meditative and awareness techniques that take clients beyond the ordinary "chatty" mind and allow the core of emotional issues to be worked out safely. When made conscious, issues can be transformed, resulting in increased awareness, changes to deeply held psychological patterns, better functioning in daily life and health and an increased sense of enjoyment, fullness and Self.

Working at the source does not mean living in the past. It means working on things held in consciousness that block you from being more of your Self here and now.

## Working with Your Potential

Human beings have much more potential than is visible at the surface. The style of work practiced by myself involves processes that are designed to put clients in touch with inner aspects of themselves. Clients experience parts of themselves that are more joyful, awake and knowing, aspects that have an innate self-healing capacity, and that can help clients move beyond mental and emotional limitations that hold them back in life. These inner aspects of human consciousness are not abstract qualities but have a direct relation to who people are and what they are able achieve in their daily lives.

Part of my work is to help clients to recognise their true nature and from there, an unravelling and ownership of their very being can begin to take place.

         You don't change by solving your problems. You solve your problems by changing. - Samuel Sagan MD

## Dynamic Awareness

For change to occur there must be awareness. 'Dynamic awareness' or awareness in action is a way of allowing the change process to keep happening between therapy sessions. It takes no extra time and is done during daily activities. Awareness techniques also provide fresh, more interesting and more dynamic ways of seeing the world.

## A Holistic View

My approach is one that incorporates different dimensions of your being: physical body, mind, vitality or the 'qi' of Chinese medicine and acupuncture; and the spiritual. These aspects of our 'selves' are not separate. They influence and interact with each other. Disease comes when this interaction is blocked. Healing and change involves taking into account and working with the whole person.

## Achieving Direct Experience

I work experientially, that is with an emphasis on your direct experience rather than on theories or beliefs.

      "Try not, do or do not, there is no try"... - Jedi Master Yoda

I specialize in working with people who have concerns with:

* People seeking to build or improve their meditation practice
* Stress, anxiety, depression
* Personal development needs
* Limiting life patterns / emotional and energetic blocks
* The effects of trauma and abuse
* Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and burnout (see below or links page for more information)
* Relationship and separation issues
* Sexual / sexuality issues
* Self-confidence, self-esteem
* Life transitions, spiritual direction, finding understanding and meaning
* Anger
* Death and dying, grief and loss
* Geopathic stress. Geopathic stress is stress that occurs through sleeping or living on areas of the earth's natural energy that are not beneficial to human beings. (See below or links page for more information)

## Modalities

Meditation, IST (Inner Space Techniques - see below), Counselling, Homeopathy, Naturopathy, Clearing Negative Energies, Dynamic Awareness, Dealing with Chronic Fatigue, Geopathic Stress

## IST

IST, or more formally known as Inner Space Techniques. More than just a technique it is a therapeutic process that employs an inner space of meditation to 'source' or look for the causes of conditioned emotions, attitudes and beliefs. It was originally designed by Samuel Sagan MD in the early 1980s for people doing long term meditation practices to remove blockages that stopped them from experiencing deeper states of consciousness. It was also found to have a profound impact on helping people reach emotional freedom in their daily lives. IST was developed into a therapy by a group of psychotherapists, doctors and natural therapists working with Dr Sagan and is now used by therapists around the world.

IST is a key tool Peter uses with clients to help them resolve issues. The inner space provides a powerful 'engine' for experiences beyond the "chatty" mind. It allows clients to see and know for themselves the causes of psychological issues. Once issues are made conscious, there can be understanding and resolution.

One of the important strengths of IST is that it integrates psychological and metaphysical dimensions. It allows clients to resolve issues through putting them in them in touch with deeper aspects of themselves. It also works to empower clients through involving clients in their own healing processes.

Often, metaphysical components of my work will engage at different times during the process. This is where deep and lasting healing takes effect.

## What happens during an IST session?

The client lies down comfortably on a mattress with eyes closed and the therapist sits by his or her side. The therapist guides the client into a meditative state. Once in this meditative state, a state of enhanced 'vision' unfolds where the clients feels and sees things in their own consciousness with increased sensitivity and awareness. An example of this may be experiencing emotions as forms or waves in consciousness, re-experiencing past events such as events from childhood or past lives with vivid sensory details, seeing blockages in the body of energy, experiencing spaces of consciousness or feeling an enhanced sense of 'self'. At times there may be release of emotions, allowing openings and deeper realisations to occur. Due to the nature of the inner space, this can occur in a fluid and untraumatic way.

Whilst in the meditative state, the therapist asks the clients questions about their experiences and an interactive space is engaged in order to help the client move deeper to the source of experiences. IST often involves a somatic component where the therapist presses a spot (depending where it is) on the client's body. This helps the client connect to emotions and sensations in the body related to issues being worked on. At all times the client is conscious and has control over the process. If the client wishes to return to a normal state of consciousness they only have to open their eyes. IST sessions usually last for up to 1.5 - 2 hours.

## Counselling

Through conversation issues are clarified, strengths revealed and goals for change established. I may incorporate a number of methods that help clients to come to a sense of clarity about issues they may be dealing with, to help raise awareness, gain other perspectives and reach a stronger sense of self. If clients wish to work at deeper levels a course of IST sessions may be suggested.

## Clearing Negative Energies

Just as there are physical parasites there are non-physical parasitical negative energies that affect the human body of energy. Energies such as these are dealt with in many forms of traditional medicine:

> The topic is both old and new. Old, because in all traditions and folklores on Earth, one finds reference to spirits and non-physical beings that can interfere with human beings. Thus Ayurveda, the traditional medicine of India, is divided into eight sections, one of which is entirely devoted to the study of bhutas, or entities, their influence on health and sanity, and the ways one can get rid of them. This places bhuta-vidya, or science of entities, on the same level as surgery or gynaecology. If we look at traditional Chinese medicine, we find that in acupuncture, among the 361 points of the 14 main meridians, 17 have the word Kuei (disincarnate spirit) as part of their main or secondary name.  
> -- <cite>Samuel Sagan, Entities, Parasites of the Body of Energy, Clairvision, 1994.</cite>

These energies may have the effect of exacerbating emotions and emotional patterns; exacerbating cravings; and draining vitality. When explored using the

IST process and then removed, using a specific clearing technique, the client no longer experiences the presence of the entity and the symptoms created by it. For example: vitality is boosted, negative emotional patterns diminish or disappear, cravings or addictions may lessen in intensity or even disappear altogether, feelings of self-confidence and a greater sense of self is restored.

## Processes for Death, Dying and Bereavement

Gentle heart-warming techniques and a supportive environment for people to prepare spirtually for death or for those experiencing bereavement after the loss of a loved one. This work helps clients reflect on the spiritual aspects of death as well to deal with the many emotions and concerns that arise when facing a death, whether it be their own or someone else's. Depending on the client's situation I may work with a package called 'Death the Great Journey' which discusses spiritual aspects of death and dying, near death experiences, reincarnation and related topics, and presents meditation techniques that can be used to facilitate the transition of death.

## Chronic Fatigue Syndrome
Fatigue is a fact of many people's daily life. Our vitality is often drained by the need to rush through life, facing conflicting pressures, ongoing stimulation from computers, telephones and media, unhealthy food and of course pollution. Not to mention the growing psychological tendencies towards neurosis and the added strain of families that are breaking apart.

Although many people feel ongoing fatigue, there are some whom it affects more than others. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) or Myalgic Encaphalomylitis (ME) is a debilitating degree of daily fatigue affecting up to 100,000 Australians. According to statistics collated by the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC), US and British statistics have estimated that between one in 500 and one in 200 people are afflicted with CFS. I have worked with CFS sufferes and had articles published on the topic.

## Naturopathic and Homoeopathic Treatment

I will from time to time recommend naturopathic and homoeopathic treatment to assist clients in their process. I have been a practicing naturopath and homoeopath for over 29 years.

## Geopathic Stress

Geopathic stress is stress caused by some types of land energies that, over time, are detrimental to human beings. A major cause of geopathic stress is 'earth lines', otherwise known as the Hartmann grid after the German researcher Dr Hartmann. These are natural earth energies that have been found to be detrimental to many living organisms including humans. Studies have found links between poor mental and physical health and sleeping on earth lines.

Geopathic stress has been implicated in a variety of conditions such as cancer, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, high blood pressure, stress, joint pains, insomnia, chronic fatigue syndrome, heart conditions, bedwetting in children and cot death.

Common reactions when sleeping in areas of geopathic stress are waking up feeling tired, irritability, nightmares and bad sleep patterns. There is enough evidence to suggest that for people suffering from various forms of illness or bad sleeping patterns, dowsing for earth lines and moving the location where you sleep will help to aid healing processes.

## About sessions

### Where to From Here?

The first thing to do is contact Peter by telephone or e-mail, ask questions you have about his processes and how he might be able to help you. Then, if you wish, you can make an appointment.

The first session is a mutual assessment to gauge whether we can work together and to begin the process of exploring what is needed. Peter will ask you some relevant questions about your life history, your health, your experiences and what you might want to achieve in sessions. There will then be time to work together using some of the techniques and processes mentioned above and to get a sense of how they might work for you. A plan for subsequent sessions will be made when appropriate. Sessions are generally 1.5 hours long. The initial consultation is usually 2 hours long.
