I have been meditating for over 35 years and had the privilege of teaching meditation in workshops and private practice all around the world.

I also employ techniques of meditation to bring about health, healing and transformation in conjunction with homoeopathy and naturopathy. Some of the outcomes of my work include resolving emotional blockages, restoring health so you are free to be yourself; achieve more of your potential and help you to recognise your true nature. In my experience many symptoms, such as anxiety, allergies, fears, depression stem from your conciousness not being free. In reality, your consciousness is independent of your physical body. In the 21st century however, it has become increasingly bound to the body resulting in increased mental and physical stresses. In other words, the general neuroses of the modern world respond well to meditation based cognitive therapies.

I have been a practicing homoeopath and naturopath for over 29 years. I've led retreats, workshops and trainings in meditation and self-development and given public lectures on various self-development and meditation related topics in Australia, Asia, Europe and the USA. I have been practicing meditation based techniques since 1988 and I graduated as a naturopath and homeopath in 1990.

Since starting my meditation path, I have spoken with many people looking for answers in meditation to many of the questions life brings up. I have spoken to many people who have said they have tried meditation but 'it's not for them', or, 'it's too hard.' To this end I offer some short videos with tips and explanations to help you improve your meditation practice.

Using meditation techniques offers a pathway of self exploration that closely integrates physical and metaphysical dimensions. Health becomes the byproduct as you move into right relationship with yourself, your psyche and your body. It covers a wide range of applications from increased mindfulness, regression and freedom from physical and mental health problems. Techniques involve meditation practice, IST - Inner Space Techniques of consciousness (therapeutic cognitive processes) to bring healing and harmony, work with death, bereavement and release from emotional blockages. Ultimately, my work is helping you to raise the voltage of your consciousness to facilitate your way of being in the world whilst being open to higher dimensions of yourself.

In my work with clients I draw from my training in homoeopathy and naturopathy together with my training and depth of personal experience in meditation, self-development work and experiences of consciousness. My evolution as a practitioner has seen me move from being a naturopath and homoeopath towards becoming a healer. My task is to find the right tool to help you move forward by incorporating it into your daily awareness. My focus also provides a framework in which to help people transform or heal. The work I do is often extremely subtle and profound. It is a work of depth seeking to bring about change at the deepest level of yourself.
