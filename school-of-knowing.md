##### Meditation Truth Presence Transformation Awakening Mindfulness 

Classes Commencing (12 month program) 

##### Your Invitation

If you are interested in developing a strong and vibrant meditation practice, consider joining my one year, weekly 2 hour online class.

##### The Syllabus

This course offers a twofold approach to building a spiritual practice anchored in truth. 

##### Tame the Mind

Firstly we will tame the mind in a simple direct path using mindfulness. That is a dynamic, moment to moment practice engaged while being in the world. 

Together we will discern the nature of the mind. To see it’s dualistic nature is the first step in becoming free and mastering the mind. Mastering this takes you to your very source where you can no longer be rocked by the comings and goings of the world. 

##### Know Yourself

Secondly we will begin a systematic exploration of what makes a human being - spiritually & psychologically. We are more than our physical body and mind. This exploration will reveal aspects of yourself that will change the way you look at yourself and the world. 

The course will take you on a self discovery path to know yourself and spiritual realms to the highest levels.
