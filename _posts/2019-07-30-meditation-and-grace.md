There are times in your meditations when a superior stillness descends upon you and the room in which you sit. Within that stillness there is peace, harmony, a receiving, a grace. I have seen rooms full of people, talking, drop into silence as this stillness descends. A pause in the busy minds of people in which something transcendent flows. 

When you feel this, let yourself open to this peace. Let yourself expand beyond the confines of your body; for you are much bigger than your little bipod body. Let yourself be receptive to the grace being bestowed upon you. Stay absolutely motionless so that you may be lifted up and rejuvenated, for this is a nourishing time for your soul and body. 

And if you feel inclined, inside yourself, offer your thanks for whatever is relevant in your life at that moment. Stay with the experience until the moment passes.   #mindfulness #experiences #peace #meditation #opening
