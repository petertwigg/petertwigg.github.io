***Leading the Paracelsus Lifestyle: Meditation, Transformation & Life****  

I retired earlier this year from working for others to focus on my own meditation and my [School of Knowing](https://petertwigg.com/school-of-knowing/). Having been trained to a very high level by my meditation teacher, what does someone who has practiced meditation for over 40 years do in his retirement?  

You meditate! So, I have embarked on a new lifestyle where I get up early, meditate until noon, then engage in my daily chores, meet people, see students, and so on. I call this my “Paracelsus Lifestyle.”  

Paracelsus was born Philippus Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim (1493–1541), a Swiss-German physician, alchemist, lay theologian, and philosopher of the German Renaissance. He took the name Paracelsus after graduating as a medical doctor in 1516. 

He is said to have been a major influence on the Rosicrucian movement of the 17th century, credited as the father of modern toxicology, and the author of several works that became foundational to the early modern medical movement that flourished after his death. He was a pioneer of the “medical revolution” of the Renaissance, emphasizing the value of observation alongside received wisdom. His lifestyle included waking up at cockcrow, engaging in his alchemical processes, writing, and spiritual practices until midday when the town crier called noon. He then spent the afternoon seeing patients until sunset.  

I’ve always felt called to explore my spirituality and to have direct experiences of spiritual realities. If this resonates with you, consider joining my School of Knowing, where each week we explore aspects of spirituality and engage in practices that strengthen our connection to spiritual worlds and beings.  

If you feel ready to take this step, reply to [this email](info@petertwigg.com), and let’s set up a time for a confidential, free 30-minute consultation to discuss how I can help you deepen your own meditation practice and spirituality.
