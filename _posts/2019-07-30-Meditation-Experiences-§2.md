Meditation is promoted as a path to achieving a silent mind. What a relief to be able to stop the mind chatter!

In truth however, achieving a silent mind (not always a simple task btw) is one that brings immense benefits. It’s part of the alignment between your body, mind and metaphysical self that takes place when you engage in a consistent meditation practice.

When that alignment occurs you experience many rewards, as byproducts, including health improvements, clearer thinking, freedom from anxieties and a stronger sense of self.

The more you practice meditation, the more you sharpen the mind. The more you cut through extraneous thoughts. And with all of this, comes a certain fullness, a kind of being where you are no longer perturbed by life’s travails.
