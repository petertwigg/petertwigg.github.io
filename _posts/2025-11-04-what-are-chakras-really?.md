What Are Chakras really?

A *chakra* is a subtle body, a non-physical organ through which consciousness expresses itself in the world. Most of us perceive reality from a limited standpoint—our awareness, filtered through our senses, hovers somewhere between what we perceive and our sense of self. This is useful: it helps us stay alive, avoid danger, and fulfill our needs.

Yet as we awaken self-awareness, we begin to notice that while we operate in the world, we are not entirely of it. A part of our consciousness feels detached—watching, waiting, belonging to something beyond. When your chakras awaken, you may perceive them as luminous tunnels of energy. Of the many chakras in the subtle body, seven are considered primary. How clearly you perceive them depends upon the degree of your spiritual vision, which itself arises from the *ajna chakra*—the centre of insight and the master key to higher consciousness.

At the centre of each chakra lies an atom or point of light, known as *bindu*—a dimensionless point that serves as a gateway into limitless consciousness. Some texts call this *chidghana,* meaning “that which is rooted in pure awareness”. Passing through that gateway, you withdraw from the confines of ordinary perception and enter the universal state that many call Self, God, the Divine, Universal Consciousness, or Oneness.

Bindu is also described as the threshold to *shoonya*, the state of stillness or void encountered on the meditator’s journey toward enlightenment. To consciously enter chidghana and yet remain active in the world is to embody true mastery. Perhaps this is what your heart truly seeks—and what the world most deeply needs.
