The double spiral helix, reflecting a microcosm of spiritual worlds. The atom effect found in chakras and nadis, energy centres of the body and flows of energy into and out of the chakra centre. 

Also reflecting our place in the macrocosm each human represented by the dot in the centre connecting heaven and earth. This is a central tenant of Taoism. In accupuncture, the needle joins heaven and earth restoring balance and harmony to the sick person.
