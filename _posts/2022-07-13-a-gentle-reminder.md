Extract from the Bhagavad Gita......

"O mighty among men, he is fit to attain immortality who is serene and not afflicted by these sensations, but is the same in pleasure and pain. 

There is no existence for the unreal and the real can never be non existent. The Seers of Truth know the nature and final ends of both. 

Know that to be indestructible by which all this is pervaded. No one is ever able to destroy that Immutable. These bodies are perishable; but the dwellers in these bodies are eternal, indestructible and  impenetrable. 

Therefore fight, O descendent of Bharata! He who considers this (Self) as a slayer or he who thinks that this (Self) is slain, neither of these knows the Truth. For It does not slay, nor is It slain. 

This (Self) is never born, nor does It die, nor after once having been, does It go into non-being. This (Self) is unborn, eternal, changeless, ancient." 

Bhagavad Gita, II, 15-20, translated by Swami Paramandenda, The Wisdom of China and India, The Modern Library, New York, Random House, 1942, p.62.
