Interested in knowing yourself to the most profound levels? 

Join My One Year Truth-Centred Meditation Course

Dear Fellow Meditator,

Are you ready to build or elevate your meditation practice and uncover a profound sense of peace and the fullness of who you can be? I'm Peter Twigg, and I'm excited to invite you to my exclusive Truth-Centred Meditation Course – a transformative journey designed for seekers like you who seek clarity, knowledge, truth, and lasting serenity in today's fast-paced world.

Through my YouTube channel @petertwiggmeditation, I've shared guided sessions and insights that have helped thousands deepen their practice. If you've enjoyed those videos, imagine the breakthroughs you'll experience in a structured course tailored to your growth. Drawing from the principles in my book, *Truth Centred Meditation*, available on Amazon, this course builds on time-tested techniques to help you align with your authentic self, reduce stress, and foster mindfulness that sticks.

What makes this course special?
* **Personalized Guidance**: Live sessions and Q&A to address your unique challenges.
* **Practical Tools**: Step-by-step exercises inspired by my book, with resources to integrate meditation into daily life.
* **Community Support**: Connect with like-minded meditators for motivation and shared experiences.
* **The Syllabus**: This course offers a twofold approach to building a spiritual practice anchored in truth.
* **Tame the Mind**: We tame the constantly chattering mind in a simple direct path using mindfulness. That is a dynamic, moment to moment practice engaged while being in the world. Together we will discern the nature of the mind. To see it’s dualistic nature is the first step in becoming free and mastering the mind. Mastering this takes you to your very source where you can no longer be rocked by the comings and goings of the world.
* **Know Yourself**: We begin a systematic exploration of what makes a human being - spiritually & psychologically. We are more than our physical body and mind. This exploration will reveal aspects of yourself that will change the way you look at yourself and the world. The course will take you on a self discovery path to know yourself and spiritual realms to the highest levels.
