Meditation offers a pathway of self exploration that closely integrates physical, mental and metaphysical dimensions. Health becomes the byproduct as you move into right relationship with yourself, your psyche and your body. Improved presence comes from increased mindfulness and a certain freedom from the vexations of the modern world. 

Engaging a strong meditation practice also brings an expanded awareness of states of consciousness, the nature of your mind, healing, harmony and release from emotional blockages. 

Ultimately, my work is helping you to raise the voltage of your consciousness to facilitate your way of being in the world whilst being open to higher dimensions of yourself.

These videos are designed to address different aspects of meditation so that you might build and sustain a strong meditation practice. It's fair to say there are many pitfalls and traps for beginners and experienced alike when it comes to meditation. I hope you gain many benefits in your meditation from watching these videos.
