### About Peter
I have been a practicing homeopath and naturopath for over 29 years. I've led retreats, workshops and trainings in meditation and self-development and given public lectures on various self-development and meditation related topics in Australia, Asia, Europe and the USA. I have been practicing meditation based techniques since 1984 and I graduated as a naturopath and homeopath in 1990.
